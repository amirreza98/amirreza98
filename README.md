**Hi, I’m Amir 👋
I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a strong backend focus, building data-intensive, real-time web applications and scalable APIs. I care about production constraints: performance, reliability, clean architecture, and measurable impact.
I have 5+ years of experience working across frontend, backend, and cloud deployment, and I’m currently based in Berlin, Germany.
